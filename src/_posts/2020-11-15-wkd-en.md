Finding PGP keys of your communication partners is still difficult in 2020.
One approach to make it easier is called OpenPGP Web Key Directory (WKD).
Your mail client will look for the key under a specific URI via HTTPS,
leveraging it's security and authenticity.

To make it easier for your friends to find your key, you can now upload it to 
our [invitation and self-service portal](https://users.systemli.org) and their
client will fetch it automatically.

A small catch: Right now, our solution doesn't support OpenPGP keys for your alias addresses.
We hope this will be resolved soon.

PS: When uploading your OpenPGP key, make sure you've already encrypted you mailbox.
